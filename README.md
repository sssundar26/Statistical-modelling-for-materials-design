# More Interpretable Machine Learning Methods for Materials Design
Quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) modeling is now more than 50 years old, and its utility has been shown in numerous research publications and by the number of new drug and agrochemical entities that have been developed with its aid. Many new types of molecular descriptors have been developed, new mathematical methods such as neural networks, support vector machines, kernel regression, and random forest have been applied to mapping structure to activity, and QSAR has now incorporated 3D structures ,conformation, and chirality. Current modelling methods use arcane mathematical descriptors which means model predictive power and interpretability remain essentially orthogonal. This work explores a particular type of molecular fragment descriptor, the signature descriptor which tries to combine accuracy and interpretability
